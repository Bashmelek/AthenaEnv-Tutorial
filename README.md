Tutorial and Survival Tips for Using AthenaEnv to make PS2 Games

AthenaEnv is not made by me, but by Github user DanielSant0s at https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv/tree/main. It am just making this starter guide.

First things first, if you have not already, is go to https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv/tree/main and follow the instructions to setup the emulator if you have not yet already. 

Go to the AthenaEnv releases(https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv/releases/tag/latest) and get the tar.gz. Extract it somewhere you can easily access.  In theory you can just use this repository for everything, but you should get the library from the actually maker
