Tutorial and Survival Tips for Using AthenaEnv to make PS2 Games
-------------------------------------------------------
AthenaEnv is not made by me, but by Github user DanielSant0s at https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv/tree/main. It am just making this starter guide.  I would also like to give thanks to https://jslegenddev.substack.com/p/you-can-now-make-ps2-games-in-javascript and to the Discord channel.
------------------------------------------------------

This is a guide for the those among you who would like a little more help to quickly make PS2 games with AthenaEnv.  AthenaEnv is a wonderful tool, and is a joy to use.  I hope you too will have fun building with it, as I have.


First things first, if you have not already, is go to https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv/tree/main and follow the instructions to setup the emulator if you have not yet already. 

Go to the AthenaEnv releases(https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv/releases/tag/latest) and get the tar.gz. Extract it somewhere you can easily access.  In theory you can just use this repository for everything, but you should get the library from the actually maker.


To have a working program in AthenaEnv you need just 3 files:
athena.elf (what you will run in your emulator)
athena.ini
a js file that athena.ini references.

So find you athena.ini, make it point to a new js file, and fill that new js file with the contents of https://github.com/Bashmelek/AthenaEnv-Tutorial/blob/main/Sophia/Tutorial_00.js.  The guide begins there.
